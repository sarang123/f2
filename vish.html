        A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works. You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.

        In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend <br>(or sometimes referred to as back end or back-end) refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware.
